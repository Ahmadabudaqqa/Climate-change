Our Project is about  How Machine learning can support one of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The goal is to apply machine learning techniques to analyze and derive meaningful insights from real-world data, while gaining hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model building, and hyperparameter tuning.
Our Assignment topic is about Climate Action (SDG13)
It talks about the Climate Change in Pakistan and the problems they faced from 1901 to 2016 and the data set will be included as well.
From 1901 to 2016, the country has undergone periodic fluctuations in annual rainfall, which have been further exacerbated by the effects of climate change. 
This proposal aims to examine the historical rainfall trends, identify the challenges posed by climate change, and propose actionable strategies to mitigate associated problems. 
The code presented analyzes rainfall data in Pakistan, performing data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, and applying various machine learning models to predict rainfall and classify it into categories (above or below average). 
Ahmad Abu Daqqa handled data preprocessing, while Selim Elhady focused on implementing machine learning models.
